# Mobile-Price-Range-Prediction:
This Project predicts the Mobile Price Range and I created this Project in my 6 weeks training during 3rd year of B.tech.

### The Following Keysteps that are performed in my created model:   
> Exploratry Data Analysis
> Data visualisation
> Feature  selection
> I used KNN algorithm in the model , In this I got maximum accuracy.
> Creating a Pickel file.

The model takes the following inputs:
>Citric Acid <br>
>Fixed Acidity <br>
>Total Sulphur Dioxide <br>
>Volatile Acidity <br>
>Sulphates <br>
>Density <br>
>Alcohol <br>

Based on these input values, the model
